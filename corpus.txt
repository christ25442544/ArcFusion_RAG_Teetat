WORK EXPERIENCE:
Al Engineer at HDmall (March 2024 - Aug 2024) (Contract)
• Led SQL-based data cleaning and deployed a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) Large Language Model (LLM) on Microsoft Azure Portal, integrating OpenAI GPT-4o's capabilities. Developed a multimodal LLM with OCR to read images of PDP packages sent by customers, enhancing customer satisfaction and achieving a 125% faster response time compared to the original CX process. Contributing to the company's ability to raise $5.6M in funding in Southeast Asia. (Read more: https:/ /techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/hd-mall-southeast-asia-ai-healthcare/)
• Fine-tuned a Large Language Model (LLM) using the QLoRA method to optimize performance and reduce hallucinations. Integrated semantic ranking through Azure and adjusted hyperparameters to maximize LLM performance.
• Integrated Elasticsearch and text-to-SQL function calling to enhance the efficiency of the Large Language Model (LLM). Implemented and managed various databases, currently using PostgreSQL with pgAdmin for monitoring, to develop a hybrid search algorithm with Google VertexAI Custom Search Engine. Employed integrated vectorization techniques in Azure to enable real-time data processing and updates every two days.
• Implemented a knowledge graph database with Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucinations and enhance the precision and response speed of a Large Language Model, achieving a 75% improvement of speed.
• Utilized Postman, Flask framework, Redis memorystore by GCP, and Python Requests library to call APls and integrate with LINE chat. This integration significantly supported the CX team by reducing their workload by 55%, handling approximately 100 customer chats per minute.
• Deploying a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) Large Language Model (LLM) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using AWS Bedrock, Lambda, Elasticache, EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk for the HDcare team, leveraging the capabilities of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Implemented a Tool Use (similar to OpenAl's function calling) to enable full-text search using text-to-SQL on an Excel file corpus. Incorporated OCR to read product information from the PDP website, classifying customer priority and identifying potential buyers. This system effectively helped the HDcare team to filter out low-priority chats and summarize the chat history, reducing their workload significantly.


WORK EXPERIENCE:
Enterprise Solutions Specialist at Thinking Machines Data Science (June 2024 - Aug 2024) (Contract)
• Assisted in deploying an Agentic-workflow type Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) Large Language Model (LLM) through Microsoft Azure Portal and Langgraph to create a State Graph. Utilized Terraform for resource provisioning and developed a streamlined Cl/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Integrated the LLM with LINE OA using FastAPI to support product sales for clients including Sabina, Tidlor, and GoWabi.
• Estimate the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) including cloud costs and labor expenses for the project. Calculated appropriate customer charges to ensure they were adequate yet competitive, aiming to maximize the company's profit.
• Collaborated with LINE Corporation to implement a Large Language Model solution integrated with LINE and LINE Shopping, targeting SMEs across Thailand to enhance their sales capabilities.


Internship (2023)
• Completed an internship at NCKU in Taiwan, where I developed a computer vision adaptive control system using the PyTorch library. Utilized the advanced deep learning model YOLOv8 for real-time video segmentation and object control.


Relevant experience (2023-now)
•	Developed and deployed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Azure OpenAI GPT-4o. This chatbot was designed to introduce myself by leveraging OpenAI's chat completion capabilities. Integrated the chatbot with LINE chat using FastAPI, allowing it to receive user messages and generate responses in real-time. This project demonstrated proficiency in using RAG to create personalized and dynamic interactions with users. 
•	Implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the TensorFlow library to translate multimodal brain images from MR to CT scans. This project, in collaboration with Chulalongkorn University Hospital, aimed to reduce radiation exposure for brain cancer and tumor patients, minimize the time required for duplicate brain scans, and lower costs by eliminating the need for external image translation software by 2,000,000 THB.
•	Responsible for cleaning the data pipeline and correlating it with partner data to analyze customer service utilization using Microsoft Azure SQL databases. This project reduced HDmall's advance payment costs for redeemed coupons from an external company by 400,000 THB.
